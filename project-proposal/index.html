# Motivational Image - Newton's Cradle

<!--_Include and describe your motivational image, how it conforms to this year's
theme and how the selected features will help to achieve that_-->

<img src="./motive.png" alt="Motivational image" class="img-responsive">

<small>
    _By Stable Diffusion, with prompt:
    "A 4-balls Newton's Cradle with the four balls (with different materials) being earth,
    moon, sun and jupyter. The background is the galaxy. In painting style."_
</small>

## Description & Why it relates to the theme

The scene I want to render is mainly a Newton's Cradle, but with a unique twist!
In this version, the conventional iron balls have been replaced by celestial bodies - an Earth, a Moon,
and various other intriguing spherical objects that defy the conventional expectations of a Newton's Cradle.
The background sets the stage with a radiant galaxy, casting a shimmering light to this cosmic display.

At first glance, it may appear to be just another Newton's Cradle,
perhaps more fancy than the average one. However, **the more you look**, a celestial revelation unfolds.
The seemingly ordinary balls reveal themselves as celestial bodies, harmonizing with the galaxy background.
More importantly, **the more you think**, one recognizes that the entire grandeur of the universe's physics
mechanism is encapsulated within this cradle. The Newton's Cradle, designed to illustrate the principles of
_Conservation of Momentum_ and _Conservation of Energy_, is a microcosm of the theory of everything,
connecting the fundamental rules governing the small balls to the unfathomable universe.

## How the selected features will help

**Depth of Field:** this camera effect will give a more realistic feel to the viewer, which also helps to
emphasize the main focus of the scene - the Newton's Cradle or maybe the most fancy ball.

**Images as Textures:** this feature is very important because it allows me to give the balls the textures.
For example, the Earth ball can be given a texture of the Earth, and the Moon ball can be given a texture of the Moon.

**Bump Mapping:** this feature helps me to give the balls the bump maps, because for example, the Moon ball
surface is not smooth, but rather has many craters. Then I can create more realistic shadows on the Moon ball
based on the mapped normals.

**Textured Area Emitters:** this feature can allow me to have an emissive earth. We are tired of being
lighted by the sun, so let's try to be lighted by the earth!

**Denoising:** Intel's Open Image Denoise Intergration can help me to reduce the noise in the rendered image.

**Modeling Meshes:** Newton's Cradle is a delicate and non-trivial object, instead of wasting time on finding its
model online, I can just model it by myself using Blender.

**Environment Map Emitter:** this feature can allow me to have the shimmering galaxy background.

**Disney BSDF:** this feature can not only help me to have the realistic material effects,
but also make the balls more interesting. For example, the Earth ball can be given a subsurface effect,
while the Moon can be made metallic.

## Validation Plan


To validate my rendering, I will conduct comparisons between the outcomes generated by Nori
and those produced by alternative rendering engines such as Mitsuba or PBRT.
Additionally, for the Disney BRDF, I can compare my results with the those presented
in the original paper.

<!--_Describe how you plan to validate them and, if needed, provide some additional information here_-->
